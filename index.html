      <h1>Hi! I'm Manu.</h1>
      <p>
        Currently: a backend software engineer, dabbling in DevOps and the frontend.
        Formerly: a graphic designer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe design and software engineering are closely related, like Yukihiro Matsumoto (a.k.a Matz) once said: 
        <i>Don't underestimate the human factor. Even thought we are in front of computers, they are media. We are working for human, with human.</i>
      </p>
      <p>One of the things makes me passionate about software engineering is how projects can be almost living things, ever-evolving and changing.</p>

          <h3>backend software engineer @ meedan</h3>
          <p>
            I currently work for Meedan, a non-profit based in the US with an all remote team. 
            My main work is on the backend of our Open-Source project, <a href="https://github.com/meedan/check" target='_blank'>Check</a>, 
            but I also work on a few projects with DevOps, and on our React frontend as well.</p>

          <h3>open source</h3>
          <p>
            During 2022's second semester, I contributed to Ruby for Good's <a href="https://github.com/rubyforgood/casa/" target='_blank'>Casa</a> project.
            It got me to participate in Hacktoberfest and try out for Outreachy. It was a great experience, and I hope to get back to it at some point.

          <h3>lightning talk</h3>
          <p>
            I had the opportunity to attend RubyConf as a scholar, and present a lightning talk on the similarities between software engineering and graphic design. 
            It's all about communicating through media after all! Be it paper, a wall, your computer or smartphone.
            You can watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WC3d3SGIUk&t=690s" target='_blank'>Ruby Central's channel</a>.

            <h3>my tiny project</h3>
            <p>
              A small Rails app to help me track which produce is in season.
              I deployed it to production setting up a droplet on Digital Ocean, configuring and installing everything myself.
              Though a tiny project, and currently paused, it holds a special place in my heart.

          <h3>mein deutsch ist kaputt</h3>
          <p>
            Despite having zero german relatives, I went to a german school.
            Nowadays, I like to say 'Mein Deutsch ist kaputt', though I'm trying to catch up on vocabulary by playing <a href="https://6mal5.com/" target='_blank'>wordle in german</a>.
